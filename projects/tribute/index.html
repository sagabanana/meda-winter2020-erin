            <ul class="events-list">
                <li><strong>Jul 6, 1907: </strong>Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo Calderón on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico. Her father, Wilhelm Kahlo—who changed his name to Guillermo Kahlo—was a German Jewish photographer; her mother, Matilde Calderon, a Catholic mestiza, or woman of mixed European and Indian ancestry.</li>
                <li><strong>1913: </strong>At age 6, Frida was struck with polio affecting the use of her right leg. Her leg grew very thin, and her foot was stunted in its growth. During her nine month convalescence, her father made sure that she regularly exercised the muscles in her leg and foot. Despite their efforts, her leg and foot remained deformed. Frida attempted to hide it by wearing pants, long skirts or two pairs of socks on her right foot. She was cruelly nicknamed "peg-leg Frida" by her childhood classmates.</li>
                <li><strong>1922: </strong>Frida commutes to Mexico City to begin classes at the National Preparatory School. Frida is one of only 35 girls to attend the prestigious school with hopes of becoming a doctor. At this point in her life she has no interest in pursuing a career as an artist.</li>
                <li><strong>1925: </strong>Considered one of Mexico's greatest artists, she began painting at the age of 18 after she was severely injured in a bus accident in September 1925. Her injuries included a broken spinal column, collarbone, pelvis, and more. Though she recovered from the injuries and eventually regained her ability to walk, she remained in extreme pain for the rest of her life.</li>
                <li><strong>1926: </strong>Frida Kahlo starts painting.  In 1925, Kahlo suffered the bus crash and turned to art during her recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>1928: </strong>Frida Kahlo joins the Mexican Communist Party</li>
                <li><strong>1929: </strong>While attending the National Preparatory School, Frida Kahlo met the artist Diego Rivera. On August 21, 1929, in a civil ceremony in the townhall of Coyoacán and wearing clothes borrowed from her Indian maid, Frida Kahlo married Diego Rivera. Diego was 42 years old, 6' 1" tall and 300 pounds; Frida was 22, 5'3" and just 98 pounds. Frida's mother did not approve of the union and did not attend the wedding ceremony. Frida's father was less resistant to the marriage and attended the ceremony.</li>
                <li><strong>1930: </strong>On November 10th, Frida and Diego arrive in San Francisco where Diego has been commissioned to paint murals in the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the California School of Fine Arts [now the San Francisco Art Institute].</li>
                <li><strong>1933: </strong>Kahlo and Rivera’s time in New York City in 1933 was surrounded by controversy. Commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller, Rivera created a mural entitled Man at the Crossroads in the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. Rockefeller halted the work on the project after Rivera included a portrait of communist leader Vladimir Lenin in the mural, which was later painted over. Months after this incident, the couple returned to Mexico and went to live in San Angel, Mexico.</li>
                <li><strong>1937: </strong>Frida Kahlo returned to Mexico to continue her work in 1937 when Leon Trotsky and his wife Natalia arrived to Mexico; Frida went single to pick them up from the Port of Tampico. They settled in her house of Coyoacán, well-known like the “Casa Azul” (Blue House). That year was one of the most prolific for Frida Kahlo, producing works like “Mi nana y yo”(My Nanny and I), “El difunto Dimas”(The Deceased Dimas), “Mis abuelos, mis padres y yo”(My grandparents, my parents and I), as well as several self-portraits. Frida's problem with the alcohol became evident. On September 23rd, four of Frida's paintings are included in a group exhibition at the Galeria de Arte at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The first public showing of Frida's work in Mexico.</li>
                <li><strong>1939: </strong>In 1939, Kahlo went to live in Paris for a time. There she exhibited some of her paintings and developed friendships such artists as Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso. She divorced Rivera later that year. During this time, she painted one of her most famous works, The Two Fridas (1939). The paintings shows two versions of the artist sitting side by side, with both of their hearts exposed. One Frida is dressed nearly all in white and has a damaged heart and spots of blood on her clothing. The other wears bold colored clothing and has an intact heart. These figures are believed to represent “unloved” and “loved” versions of Kahlo.</li>

                <li><strong>1944: </strong>Frida Kahlo starts keeping a diary</li>

The cause of death was officially reported as "pulmonary embolism". Suicide was suspected but never confirmed. Diego refused to believe that she was actually dead claiming that she still showed signs of life. To prove to him that she was really dead, a doctor cut open a vein and she did not bleed.</li>
